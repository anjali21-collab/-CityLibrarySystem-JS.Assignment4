A Java-based console application designed to manage books, members, and issuing activities in a small city library.  
It supports storing data in text files, making it persistent across program restarts.

## Features

- Add new books with details such as title, author, and category  
- Register new library members  
- Issue and return books with validation  
- Search books by title, author, or category  
- Sort books alphabetically by title or author  
- Automatically save and load all records using text files  
- Maintain issued book lists for each member

## Concepts Used

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- Classes, objects, and encapsulation  
- File handling using **BufferedReader** and **BufferedWriter**  
- Collections Framework (**Map, List, ArrayList, HashMap**)  
- Exception handling  
- **Comparable** interface and custom sorting  
- Menu-driven console interaction  

---

## How It Works

The system stores all books and members in **HashMaps** for quick access.  
Book and member details are serialized into text files, enabling persistent storage.  
Users can manage library operations through a menu interface, including issuing, returning, and searching for books.
